## PROBLEM STATEMENT
While exam-style questions are a fundamental educational tool serving a variety of purposes,
manual construction of questions is a complex process that requires training, experience, and
resources.This, in turn, hinders and slows down the use of educational activities (e.g. providing practice
questions) and new advances that require a large pool of questions.
To reduce the expenses associated with manual construction of questions and to satisfy the
need for a continuous supply of new questions, automatic question generation (AQG)
techniques were introduced.
